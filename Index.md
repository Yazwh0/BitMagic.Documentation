# What is BitMagic?

BitMagic is a project whose aim is to create a Commander X16 Development Suite based within VSCode. It has a good compatibility with the X16, although not 100%. You can follow compatibility issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yazwh0/BitMagic/issues).

The debugger includes a fully featured compiler that includes a macro language that can do everything a developer couple possibly want.

From within VSCode you can develop and debug like you would with any modern language.

BitMagic rounds off the sharp corners of 65c02 development, making retro dev fun!

## Support

Please understand that as this is single person project support is limited.

For bug reports and other issues with BitMagic please post them at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Yazwh0/BitMagic/issues) so they don't get lost.

If you have any questions about the BitMagic or the X16, there are the official [X16 forums](https://cx16forum.com/forum/) and the associated [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/nS2PqEC).

The X16 project has some great documentation, so for general X16 system related queries its worth checking [there](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-docs/tree/master) before anywhere else.

Hopefully you'll find the answer at one of those locations!

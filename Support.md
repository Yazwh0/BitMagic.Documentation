Please understand that as this is single person project support is limited.

For bug reports and other issues with BitMagic please post them at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Yazwh0/BitMagic/issues) so they don't get lost.

If you have any questions about the BitMagic or the X16, there are the official [X16 forums](https://cx16forum.com/forum/) and the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/nS2PqEC).

The X16 project has some great documentation, so for general queries its worth checking [there](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-docs/tree/master).

Hopefully you'll find the answer at one of those locations!

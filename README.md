# BitMagic Documentation

This repo holds the documentation for the [BitMagic](https://bitmagic.org) website.

It is a static website build using Jekyll and hosted on GitLab Pages.

## Local Building

Using VSCode there is a Task registered to start serving the page locally.

Start this by opening the command palette, selecting `Tasks: Run Task` and then `Serve`. Follow the prompts in the terminal to open using your browser.

## Browsing

The site can be browsed via GitLab, which you can do [here](Index.md).

## Base Theme

The theme is based off the 'Hacker' theme for GitLab pages, located [here](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker).

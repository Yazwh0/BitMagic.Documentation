# BitMagic

BitMagic is a project with the aim to create a single Commander X16 Development Suite using VSCode.

It is comprised of four parts:

- [Template Engine](/TemplateEngine)
- [Compiler](/Compiler)
- [Debugger](/Debugger)
- [Emulator](/Emulator)

Generally you'll want to start with either the Debugger or the Emulators, so please follow those links for more information!

Please note, this is not an 'official' application that is endorsed by the Commander X16 team.

It is also a work in progress, for development you may find the [Official Emulator](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-emulator) or [Box16](https://github.com/indigodarkwolf/box16) a better choice.

You will need to obtain a R46 (or later) [Rom](/Rom).

# What is BitMagic?

BitMagic is a project whose aim is to create a Commander X16 Development Suite based within VSCode. It has a good compatibility with the X16, although not 100%. You can follow compatibility issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/Yazwh0/BitMagic/issues).

The debugger includes a fully featured compiler that includes a macro language that can do everything a developer couple possibly want.

From within VSCode you can develop and debug like you would with any modern language.

BitMagic rounds off the sharp corners of 65c02 development, making the retro dev fun!

# BitMagic - The Template Engine

The template engine is the equivalent of a [macro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)) in other languages. It allows us to write macros using c# so we can generate text files. For BitMagic we use this functionality to create `.bmasm` files which can be compiled for the Commander 16.

Currently the debugger and compiler do not use this functionality directly, so this will be filled out when this is in place.

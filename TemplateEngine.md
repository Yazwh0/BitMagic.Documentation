# BitMagic - The Template Engine

**Please note the documentation is a currently a work in progress while the old docs are brought up to date.**

The template engine is the equivalent of a [macro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)) in other languages. It allows us to write macros using c# so we can generate text files. For BitMagic we use this functionality to create `.bmasm` files which can be compiled for the Commander 16.

Currently the debugger and compiler do not use this functionality directly, so this will be filled out when this is in place.

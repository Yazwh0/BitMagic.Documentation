## Dataport Test Application

An little test application which tests different opcodes on the DATA0 dataport, to see if there are any multiple reads or writes and compare the outcome vs hardware.

The source demonstrates how macros can be used to make large complex tasks easier and how lines of source can be [generated and debugged](/Debugger/multiline-template-code).

## Not made with BitMagic but made by me!

The intro that started it all. It was trying to debug ca65's macro code that made me want to write my own compiler as I simply couldn't find out how to see what the macro code produced. The loop of using VSC to write code, ca65 to compile and then run in the official emulator was such a burden. I knew there could be a better way!
